# Scintillation routines adapted from (and parameters tuned using) the ScintillationMaker project:

# Original C++/Python implementation by SprengerT (see repository for details).
# Scintillation parameter file for FIRES
# Units:
#   t_s      : seconds
#   nu_s     : Hz (decorrelation bandwidth)
# Notes:
#   Gain applied multiplicatively to all Stokes before noise (recommended).
#   Set enable=false to bypass without deleting file.
