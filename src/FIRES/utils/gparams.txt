#	Parameters for Gaussian components	
#
#	Each row represents a Gaussian components
#   
#   THE THIRD LAST ROW REPRESENTS THE FACTORS TO MODULATE THE GAUSSIAN PARAMETERS BY (ONLY FOR THE MGAUSS MODE)
#   THE SECOND LAST ROW REPRESENTS A VARIANCE RANGE FROM THIRD LAST ROW FOR PLOTTING 
#   THE LAST ROW IS THE STEP SIZE
#       - only one value can be varied --- make sure only one value in the final row is != 0
#
#	Columns:
#	t0(ms)		  - Time offset of the Gaussian pulse in milliseconds
#	W(ms)		  - Width of the Gaussian pulse in milliseconds
#	Peak		  - Peak amplitude of the Gaussian pulse
#	Spec		  - Spectral index of the Gaussian pulse
#	DM			  - Dispersion measure in pc/cm^3
#	RM			  - Rotation measure in rad/m^2
#	PA(rad)		  - Polarization angle in radians
#	(L/I)		  - Linear polarization fraction
#	(V/I)		  - Circular polarization fraction
#	dpadt(rad/ms) - Change in polarization angle with time in rad/ms
#	Other 		  - Placeholder for any additional parameters
